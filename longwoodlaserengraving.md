# Longwood Laser Engraving: Financial Statements

## Introduction
In this case study, we are hired by Longwood Laser Engraving to provide financial statements using Excel. We are asked for:
- Income Statements for the years 2008 and 2009, Balance Sheet for the year ended December 31, 2009
- Statement of Cash Flows for 2009
- Income Statements for the years 2008 and 2009, Balance Sheet for the year ended December 31, 2009 (common size)

We use formulas, references, formatting, and other tools in Excel to create our financial statements. 

Our complete financial statements can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dpJE3-EFm5VbwNiuN-lKzWQC7l3n6_P4?usp=sharing).

## Statement of Cash Flows
We are asked to recreate a Statement of Cash Flows for 2009. We are challenged to not enter any numbers on this worksheet. All formulas should be linked directly to the source on previous worksheets. We are then asked to use Excel's outlining feature to create an outline that, when collapsed, shows only the subtotals for each section.
