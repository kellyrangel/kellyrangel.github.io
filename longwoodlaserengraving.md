## Introduction
In this case study, we are hired by Longwood Laser Engraving to provide financial statements using Excel. We are asked for:
- Income Statements for the years 2008 and 2009, Balance Sheet for the year ended December 31, 2009
- Statement of Cash Flows for 2009
- Income Statements for the years 2008 and 2009, Balance Sheet for the year ended December 31, 2009 (common-size)

We use formulas, references, formatting, and other tools in Excel to create our financial statements. 

Our complete financial statements can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dpJE3-EFm5VbwNiuN-lKzWQC7l3n6_P4?usp=sharing).

## Income Statements and Balance Sheet
We are asked to recreate the following Income Statements and Balance Sheet using formulas wherever possible. We are also asked to duplicate the formatting exactly.

We used arithmetic operators (subtraction, multiplication, division), the SUM() function, and references to other cells to construct formulas and recreate the Income Statements. To duplicate the formatting, we change the font to bold, increase indents, change the fill color, add borders, and change the number format (currency, percent, decimals).

To construct formulas and recreate the Balance Sheet, we used arithmetic operators (subtraction, addition, multiplication), the SUM() function, and references to other cells.

## Statement of Cash Flows
Next, we are asked to recreate a Statement of Cash Flows for 2009. We are challenged to not enter any numbers on this worksheet; all formulas should be linked directly to the source on previous worksheets. We are also asked to use Excel's outlining feature to create an outline that, when collapsed, shows only the subtotals for each section.

To recreate the Statement of Cash Flows, we use references to our previous worksheets, the arithmetic operator for subtraction, and the SUM() function. To duplicate the formatting, we change the font (bold, italic), increase indents, add borders, and change the number format (currency, decimals). To create an outline, we use the Group option under Data section.
